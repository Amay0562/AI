	<p class = "p2">AI (Artificial Intelligence) has become an integral part of everyday life in various ways, often working behind the scenes to improve efficiency, convenience, and the overall quality of our experiences. Here are some common applications of AI in daily life:</p>
	<ol>
		<li class = "l2" >Virtual Assistants:</li><p><blockquote class = "p2"> Virtual assistants like Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa, Google Assistant, and Microsoft's Cortana use AI to understand and respond to voice commands. They can set reminders, answer questions, control smart home devices, and provide personalized recommendations.</blockquote></p>

		<li class = "l2">Recommendation Systems:</li><p><blockquote class = "p2"> AI-driven recommendation algorithms are used by streaming services (Netflix, Spotify), e-commerce platforms (Amazon, eBay), and social media (Facebook, Instagram) to suggest content, products, and connections based on user preferences and behavior.</blockquote></p>

		<li class = "l2">Online Shopping:</li><p><blockquote class = "p2"> AI-powered chatbots provide real-time customer support on e-commerce websites. Additionally, AI algorithms can optimize pricing, inventory management, and fraud detection to enhance the overall online shopping experience.</blockquote></p>

		<li class = "l2">Healthcare:</li><p><blockquote class = "p2"> <span class = "s1">AI assists doctors</span> in diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images (X-rays, MRIs), and predicting patient outcomes. It also enables wearable devices and health apps to monitor and provide health recommendations.</blockquote></p>

		<li class = "l2">Autonomous Vehicles:</li><p><blockquote class = "p2"> Self-driving cars use AI to process sensor data (cameras, lidar, radar) and make real-time driving decisions. These vehicles have the potential to revolutionize transportation in the near future.</blockquote></p>
