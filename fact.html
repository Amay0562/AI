</p>

	<ol>
		<li><strong>AI Goes Back to Ancient Times:</strong></li> <p><blockquote class = "p4"> While modern AI is relatively recent, the concept of artificial beings with human-like intelligence dates back to ancient civilizations, including Greek mythology's automatons and the legendary Golem in Jewish folklore.</blockquote></p>

		<li><strong>The Term "Artificial Intelligence"</strong></li> <p><blockquote class = "p4" >Was Coined in 1956: The term "artificial intelligence" was first used at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956 when a group of researchers gathered to discuss the emerging field.</blockquote></p>

		<li><strong>AI Can Beat Humans at Chess and Go:</strong></li> <p><blockquote class = "p4">IBM's Deep Blue became the first computer to beat a reigning world chess champion (Garry Kasparov) in 1997. Later, Google's AlphaGo defeated the world Go champion, Lee Sedol, in 2016.</blockquote></p>

		<li><strong>AI in Space Exploration:</strong></li> <p><blockquote class = "p4"> NASA's Mars rovers, like Curiosity and Perseverance, use AI for autonomous navigation and decision-making on the Martian surface.</blockquote></p>

		<li><strong>AI-Generated Art Sold for Millions:</strong></li> <p><blockquote class = "p4"> An AI-generated artwork called "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy" sold at auction for over $432,000 in 2018. This raised questions about the role of AI in creative fields.</blockquote></p>

		<li><strong>Chatbots Can Pass the Turing Test:</strong></li> <p><blockquote class = "p4">Some chatbots, like GPT-3, have come close to passing the Turing Test, a measure of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from that of a human.</blockquote></p>
