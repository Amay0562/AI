	<p class = "p1">Artificial Intelligence, often abbreviated as AI, is a revolutionary field of computer science that focuses on creating systems and machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, decision-making, learning from data, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and adapting to changing circumstances. AI is at the forefront of technological advancement and has far-reaching implications in various aspects of our daily lives.</p>

		<li class = "l1"><strong>Machine Learning:</strong></li><p><blockquote> Machine learning is a subset of AI that empowers computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms and statistical models to make predictions and decisions.</blockquote></p>

		<li class = "l1"><strong>Neural Networks:</strong></li> <p><blockquote>Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure of the human brain. They are fundamental to deep learning, a subfield of machine learning that has achieved remarkable success in tasks like image and speech recognition.</blockquote></p>

		<li class = "l1"><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong></li> <p><blockquote>NLP is the branch of AI that deals with enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It is the technology behind chatbots, language translation, and sentiment</blockquote></p>
